# Project State: BuildScale

**Project Reference**

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Designers can create building components in 3D, validate against Canadian building codes, generate manufacturing specifications with parts lists, and send production-ready files to vetted suppliers in their preferred language and CAD format.

**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation Repair

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation Repair**

**Goal:** Fix critical issues in existing codebase to create a solid foundation

**Requirements:** CRIT-01 through CRIT-07

**Status:** ○ Not Started

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Panel calculator generates practical layouts
- [ ] API input validation working
- [ ] DXF/SVG exports functional
- [ ] Examples executable
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Tests with assertions

---

## Completed Work

- ✓ Codebase mapped (7 analysis documents created)
- ✓ Project initialized (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md)
- ✓ Critical issues identified and documented

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Phased approach | Deliver working software incrementally | ✓ Agreed |
| Fix existing vs rewrite | Foundation must be solid | ✓ Fix existing |
| Canadian codes first | Start specific, expand later | ✓ Canada first |
| 12-week beta timeline | Realistic for working software | ✓ 12 weeks |

## Next Actions

1. Research Phase 1 implementation approach
2. Create Phase 1 plans
3. Execute Phase 1
