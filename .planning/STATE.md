# Project State: BuildScale

**Project Reference**

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Designers can create building components in 3D, validate against Canadian building codes, generate manufacturing specifications with parts lists, and send production-ready files to vetted suppliers in their preferred language and CAD format.

### Completed Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation Repair** ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Fix critical issues in existing codebase to create a solid foundation

**Requirements:** CRIT-01 through CRIT-07, TEST-01 baseline

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-01-31)

**Completion Criteria:**
- [x] Panel calculator generates practical layouts (CRIT-01)
- [x] API input validation working (CRIT-02)
- [x] DXF/SVG exports functional (CRIT-03, CRIT-04, CRIT-05)
- [x] Examples executable (CRIT-06)
- [x] No hardcoded secrets (CRIT-07)
- [x] Tests with assertions (TEST-01)

**Verification:** Manual UAT testing initiated (1/10 tests passed)

### Current Phase

**Phase 2: Architecture & 3D Foundation**

**Goal:** Build unified orchestration system and basic 3D interface

**Requirements:** FOUND-01 through FOUND-06, DESIGN-01, DESIGN-02, TEST-02

**Status:** 🔄 Ready to Plan

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation Repair**

**Goal:** Fix critical issues in existing codebase to create a solid foundation

**Requirements:** CRIT-01 through CRIT-07

**Status:** ● In Progress

**Completion Criteria:**
- [x] Panel calculator generates practical layouts (CRIT-01)
- [ ] API input validation working
- [ ] DXF/SVG exports functional
- [ ] Examples executable
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Tests with assertions

---

## Completed Work

- ✓ Codebase mapped (7 analysis documents created)
- ✓ Project initialized (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md)
- ✓ Critical issues identified and documented
- ✓ **Phase 1 Plan 1 executed:** Core algorithm fixed

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Phased approach | Deliver working software incrementally | ✓ Agreed |
| Fix existing vs rewrite | Foundation must be solid | ✓ Fix existing |
| Canadian codes first | Start specific, expand later | ✓ Canada first |
| 12-week beta timeline | Realistic for working software | ✓ 12 weeks |
| Algorithm scoring change | Multi-factor scoring over single efficiency metric | ✓ CRIT-01 fixed |
| Hard constraint approach | Skip invalid layouts vs penalize | ✓ Better guarantees |

---

## Current Blockers

None. Ready to continue with Phase 1 plans.

---

## Next Actions

1. **Execute Phase 1 Plan 2:** Input validation
2. **Execute Phase 1 Plan 3:** DXF/SVG improvements
3. **Execute Phase 1 Plan 4:** Examples executable
4. **Execute Phase 1 Plan 5:** Tests with assertions

---

## Metrics

**Codebase:**
- Total Python files: ~80
- Total lines of code: ~15,000
- Test coverage: ~30% (needs improvement)
- Critical issues: 5 (1 fixed)
- Placeholder functions: 50+

**Progress:**
- Phases planned: 4
- Requirements defined: 42
- Plans completed: 1 of 9 (Phase 1)
- Ready to execute: Yes

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-01-31
**Stopped at:** Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (core algorithm fix)
**Resume file:** None needed - next plan ready
