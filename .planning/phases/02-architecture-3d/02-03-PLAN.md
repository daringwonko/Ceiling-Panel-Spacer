# Phase 2 Plan 3: 3D Architecture Building

## Objective

Build the core 3D architecture component editor with push-pull extrusion, real-time dimensional feedback, and a component library for building design components.

## Context

See .planning/phases/02-architecture-3d/02-3D-FRONTEND-SCOUT-RESEARCH.md for technology research and recommended architecture.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Setup 3D canvas with camera controls

**Description:** Install React Three Fiber and setup basic 3D canvas with orbit/pan/zoom controls

**Type:** auto

**Verification:** Canvas renders, camera controls work smoothly

### Task 2: Build component library with 3D primitives

**Description:** Create Material-UI component library with draggable primitives (cube, cylinder, plane)

**Type:** auto

**Verification:** Library displays, primitives draggable to canvas

### Task 3: Implement component editor with push-pull extrusion

**Description:** Add push-pull interaction to modify component shapes with visual feedback

**Type:** auto

**Verification:** Select face, extrude by dragging shows live preview

### Task 4: Add real-time dimension display system

**Description:** Implement overlay measurement system showing real-time dimensions during interactions

**Type:** auto

**Verification:** Dimensions display, update during modifications, accurate measurements

## Verification Criteria

- 3D canvas loads with working orbit/pan/zoom controls
- Component library shows primitives as draggable
- Push-pull extrusion works with visual feedback during operation
- Dimensions update in real-time during component interactions

## Success Criteria

All four tasks completed, 3D architecture building interface functional with component manipulation and measurement display.

## Output Specification

3D frontend components in /frontend directory, integrated into existing React application.
