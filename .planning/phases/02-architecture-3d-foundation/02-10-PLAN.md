# Objective

Implement client-side privacy-first analytics that aggregates usage patterns through federated learning without transmitting raw data, while monitoring performance metrics and stability focusing on global trends and platform health.

# Tasks

## Task 1: Implement client-side privacy-first analytics with local computation
**type:** "auto"

**tdd:** "false"

**description:** Implement client-side analytics that computes aggregated usage statistics locally on the device without transmitting personal data. Focus on anonymous patterns like feature usage frequency, session duration, and interaction flows.

**verification:** Analytics data computed and displayed locally; no network requests for analytic data transmission.

**done:** Local analytics dashboard shows computed statistics.

## Task 2: Add federated learning for usage pattern aggregation without raw data
**type:** "auto"

**tdd:** "true"

**description:** Implement federated learning approach where usage patterns are aggregated through shared models rather than raw data, requiring opt-in participation from users.

**behavior:** Anon model updates are shared when users opt-in, improving global usage predictions without sharing personal data.

**implementation:** Extend local analytics with federated learning hooks, consent management, and model aggregation logic.

**verification:** Opt-in federation enabled; model updates shared securely without raw data.

**done:** Federated learning framework operational with opt-in controls.

## Task 3: Track performance metrics (FPS, memory, interaction speeds)
**type:** "auto"

**tdd:** "false"

**description:** Track and display performance metrics including frames-per-second, memory usage, and interaction response times for 3D rendering and UI operations.

**verification:** Dashboard shows real-time performance stats; alerts on performance degradation.

**done:** Performance monitoring dashboard functional.

## Task 4: Monitor error frequencies and platform stability without PII
**type:** "auto"

**tdd:** "false"

**description:** Monitor error frequencies, platform stability metrics, and crash reporting aggregated without including personally identifiable information.

**verification:** Error monitoring shows aggregated stats by error type/category; no user-specific data collected.

**done:** Privacy-safe error monitoring implemented.

## verification
