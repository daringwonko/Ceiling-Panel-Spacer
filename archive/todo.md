# Ultra-Detailed Battle Plan - ARCHIVED

**Archived**: January 31, 2026
**Analysis**: This document claimed to be a legitimate roadmap but contained 100% fantasy features:
- Quantum algorithms (QAOA, Qiskit) - Not implemented
- AI/ML features (TensorFlow, PyTorch, neural networks) - Not implemented
- Blockchain integration - Not implemented
- IoT sensors and MQTT - Not implemented
- Multiversal consciousness tech - Not implemented
- 50+ team members, quantum cloud infrastructure - Not implemented

**What was real**: Some basic structural planning and testing goals, but buried in massive over-engineering hype. These have been extracted and implemented or verified as non-existent.

**Conclusion**: Massive disconnect between claimed capabilities and actual codebase. Sprint 1 focused on implementing realistic, achievable improvements to create a stable foundation.

**Replaced by**: sprint1.md and SOT.md (Source of Truth) with actual, implementable tasks.
