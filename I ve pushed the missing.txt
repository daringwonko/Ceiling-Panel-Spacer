I've pushed the missing commits to a new branch. Here's what happened:

New branch pushed: claude/add-setup-guide-7LZ9n

Contains 2 commits:

    feat: Add simple all-in-one app for easy testing (run_app.py)
    docs: Add comprehensive setup guide for beginners (SETUP_GUIDE.md)

To merge these into main, create a PR here:

https://github.com/daringwonko/Ceiling-Panel-Spacer/pull/new/claude/add-setup-guide-7LZ9n

Or you can view the branch directly:

https://github.com/daringwonko/Ceiling-Panel-Spacer/tree/claude/add-setup-guide-7LZ9n

The files you need (run_app.py and SETUP_GUIDE.md) are on that branch ready to be merged!
